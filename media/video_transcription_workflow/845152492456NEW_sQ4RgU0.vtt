00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:11.840
In this video, we’re gonna take a look at how to pronounce this man’s name, and we’re gonna talk about his last theorem and Homer Simpson’s proof by counterexample that it was, in fact, wrong.

2
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.760
But before we do all that, let’s think about the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras’s theorem, as it’s often known.

3
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.440
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the longer side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other sides.

4
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:36.160
So in this diagram, if 𝑎 is the length of this side, 𝑏 is the length of this side, and 𝑐 is the length of this side, then 𝑎 squared plus 𝑏 squared equals 𝑐 squared.

5
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.120
Now there’re lots of proofs that this is true, even an American president, James Garfield, wrote a nice proof back in the 1870s.

6
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.840
Now we’re gonna concentrate on some special cases of the Pythagorean theorem in which 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 all turn out to be whole numbers or integers, and we call them Pythagorean triples.

7
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:06.000
For example, if side 𝑎 was three units, side 𝑏 was four units, and side 𝑐 was five units, that would give us three squared plus four squared equals five squared.

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.040
And three squared is nine, four squared is 16, five squared is 25, and nine plus 16 is indeed equal to 25.

9
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.600
So three, four, and five are all integers, and they make a Pythagorean triple.

10
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.120
In fact, there are an infinite number of Pythagorean triples, and there’s even a nice little method to generate them.

11
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.800
Start with a pair of integers, 𝑚 and 𝑛, where 𝑚 is bigger than 𝑛 and 𝑛 is bigger than zero.

12
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.920
Then let 𝑎 equal 𝑚 squared minus 𝑛 squared, 𝑏 equal two times 𝑚 times 𝑛, and 𝑐 equals 𝑚 squared plus 𝑛 squared.

13
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.600
Then 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 will be a Pythagorean triple.

14
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:58.920
So for example, if we said 𝑚 was 10 and 𝑛 was three, then 𝑎 would be 10 squared minus three squared, so that’s a 100 minus nine which is 91, 𝑏 would be two times 10 times three which is 60, and 𝑐 would be 10 squared plus three squared which is 109.

15
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.960
And if we just check that they work, 𝑎 squared plus 𝑏 squared equals 𝑐 squared, we get 91 squared plus 60 squared equals 109 squared.

16
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.000
And yes, that does work.

17
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.400
But there’s nothing new here.

18
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.720
We’ve known about the Pythagorean theorem and Pythagorean triples for a very long time.

19
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.360
In fact, in the 1630s, Pierre de Fermat was reading about them in his copy of Arithmetica by Diophantus of Alexandria, and that was written in the third century A.D.

20
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.680
Ahaa, so there we are, we’ve covered the first of our objectives.

21
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
Lots of people call him “Fermat” but his real name is Pierre de Fermat.

22
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:47.040
Now, this got Fermat wondering, whether he could find similar integer solutions to equations like 𝑎 cubed plus 𝑏 cubed equals 𝑐 cubed, or 𝑎 to the four plus 𝑏 to the four equals 𝑐 to the four.

23
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.800
But after lots of trying, he could only find trivial solutions where one or more of 𝑎, 𝑏, or 𝑐 was zero.

24
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.320
For example: 𝑎 is zero, 𝑏 is five, 𝑐 is five.

25
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:24.560
Then Fermat wrote this conjecture in the margin of his copy of Arithmetica, although he wrote it in Latin: “It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers.” Or as we might say, no integer solutions exist for 𝑎 to the power of 𝑛 plus 𝑏 to the power of 𝑛 equals 𝑐 to the power of 𝑛, where 𝑛 is greater than two.

26
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:34.920
Then he added to the page: “I’ve discovered a truly marvelous proof of this which this margin is too narrow to contain.” And this intrigued mathematicians for centuries.

27
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.720
Many have tried and failed to find this proof.

28
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:47.640
But it wasn’t until October 1994 that an actual proof was submitted by Andrew Wiles, 358 years after the conjecture was made.

29
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.680
Now whilst Andrew Wiles’ proof is certainly marvelous, it isn’t the one that Fermat had in mind.

30
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.200
It refers to several strands of mathematics that weren’t known about in Fermat’s day.

31
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.160
So maybe there’s still a challenge there for you, find the original proof.

32
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:14.000
So to sum things up, it has actually been proved that 𝑎 to the power of 𝑛 plus 𝑏 to the power of 𝑛 equals 𝑐 to the power of 𝑛 has no nontrivial integer solutions for 𝑛 is greater than two.

33
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:33.720
Then in the 1998 episode of The Simpsons, called The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace, Homer writes this on his board: 3987 to the power of 12 plus 4365 to the power of 12 equals 4472 to the power of 12.

34
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560
Try it on your calculator.

35
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:51.720
Type in 3987 to the power of 12 plus 4365 to the power of 12, and then take the 12th root of that answer and, unless you’ve got a very sophisticated calculator, it probably will give the answer 4472.

36
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.960
It works!

37
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.560
Homer has disproved Fermat’s last theorem by finding a counterexample.

38
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.880
Now the difference between proving and disproving something can be quite enormous.

39
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.600
To prove something is true, you need to prove it for every single possible case.

40
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.480
But to disprove it, you just need to come up with one counterexample.

41
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:23.160
So in this one counterexample, it seems that Homer Simpson has disproved Fermat’s last theorem and overturned Andrew Wiles’ proof; or has he?

42
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.440
Well, the issue here is that most calculators only hold a certain number of significant digits, usually 10.

43
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:41.560
So for example, 3987 to the power of 12 would be saved as 1.613447461 times 10 to the power of 43.

44
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.520
Now that’s 16 34 [134] 474 61 with 34 zeros after it.

45
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.120
The calculator has lost track of loads of digits and stored an answer that isn’t entirely precise.

46
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.800
Now the actual answer is this, and you can see that there’s quite a difference in terms of these digits.

47
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:09.840
And the accurate result for the 12th root of 3987 to the power of 12 plus 4365 to the power of 12 is this.

48
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:19.280
But because our calculator only holds 10 significant figures, it thought the answer was this, which is 4472.

49
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.680
Look, if we do the calculation accurately, we get this for the left-hand side and this for the right-hand side.

50
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.720
And the difference is over one decillion.

51
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.000
Now your calculator didn’t spot it because it was only concentrating on these 10 significant figures up here, and they’re all exactly the same.

52
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.960
Now one thing that I particularly like about this example, is that even if you do a check on the last digits, they do agree.

53
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:55.240
So for example, if you spotted that the significant figure limitations of your calculator were stopping you from getting an accurate answer, you could at least check the value of the last digit.

54
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.240
And if they weren’t the same on the left-hand side and the right-hand side, then you’d know that it wasn’t true.

55
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.920
Let’s have a look at what the last digit of this calculation is going to be.

56
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.120
Well, the last digit’s gonna come from multiplying seven by itself 12 times.

57
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.240
And seven times seven is 49, so the last digit of that is nine.

58
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.880
And nine times seven is 63, and the last digit of that is three.

59
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.440
Three times seven is 21, and the last digit of that is one.

60
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.480
One times seven is seven; obviously, the last digit of that is seven.

61
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.720
Then we’re back to seven times seven is 49, and the last digit of that is nine.

62
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.920
Nine times seven 63, the last digit’s three.

63
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.120
Three times seven has a last digit of one.

64
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.160
One times seven has a last digit of seven.

65
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.320
Seven times seven has a last digit of nine.

66
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.840
Nine times seven has a last digit of three, and three times seven has a last digit of one.

67
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.720
And for the next number, we’re gonna get the last digit by multiplying 12 fives together.

68
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:11.760
Now obviously, five times five is 25 which has a last digit of five, and we’re gonna go through using the same pattern.

69
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.240
This is going to end in a five.

70
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.280
So the last digit on the left-hand side is gonna be one plus five which is six.

71
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.920
Then if we follow that same procedure through for the right-hand side, we also find that it has a last digit of six.

72
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.240
Now if they’d been different digits, we’d have immediately known that this example didn’t work.

73
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:52.920
In fact, in another episode of The Simpsons, they showed this example which again, works on your calculator, but you could immediately spot a problem because that first number to the power of 12 is gonna end in an even digit, the second number to the power of 12 is going to be odd, but the last digit of the number on the right-hand side must be even.

74
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.400
Now when you add an even number to an odd number, the result is odd.

75
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.800
So the left-hand side had an odd last digit, but the right-hand side had an even last digit.

76
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.520
That clearly wasn’t going to work.

77
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:13.280
So to sum it all up, we’ve talked about the Pythagorean theorem, how to pronounce Fermat, and we’ve talked about Fermat’s last theorem.

78
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.840
And although his example was very clever indeed, Homer Simpson did not disprove Fermat’s last theorem.
